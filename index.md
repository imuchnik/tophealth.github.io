Starting October 2018, Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) kicked-off and will lead a 14-week tech sprint with the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other digital enthusiasts.

The goal of this tech sprint is to transform federal open data from HHS, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA), and other agencies into digital tools. Modeled after The Opportunity Project (TOP) at U.S. Department of
Commerce, the TOP Health tech sprint is specifically designed to improve the patient experience, for example, by
assisting in novel therapeutics accessibility and improving clinical trials.

Presidential Innovation Fellows will lead a cohort of tech teams that are developing an ecosystem that leverages
artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to help patients find new types of treatments. Several unique aspects of
this tech sprint include cross-agency participation to create an ecosystem around a specific challenge, AI-centric
data design, iteratively released data for training and testing, health-specific cohort, and access to specialized
resources to foster a new AI-centric ecosystem. As part of this process, several industry partners have been chosen
to participate

### Data

Github repository/data/code will be made available and updated [here](https://tophealth.github.io/data/)

The data is encoded using [NCIt](https://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/pages/home.jsf) where possible (with mappings possible to others, such as SNOMED, etc.).
For the data set 1 (eligibility data) format, an example is for [HIV](./sample/dataset1_example_struct_elig_criteria_hiv_format.xlsx>dataset1_example_struct_elig_criteria_hiv_format.xlsx)

1. For data set 2 (participant data) format, please see [dataset2_example_participant_format.xlsx](./sample/dataset2_example_participant_format.xlsx).
