Cohort 1 (NSCLC cohort) * Ability to undergo a fresh tumor biopsy for the purpose of screening for this clinical trial (including able and willing to give valid written consent) to ability or to provide an available archival tumor sample taken less than 3 months prior to study enrollment (and not obtained prior to progression on a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor) if a fresh tumor biopsy is not feasible with an acceptable clinical risk; tumor lesions used for fresh biopsies should be the same lesions to be irradiated when possible and should not be the same lesions used as Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) target lesions, unless there are no other lesions accessible; additional, optional archival tumor tissue is also requested from before the prior PD-1 directed therapy

Cohort 2 (colorectal cohort) * Ability to undergo a fresh tumor biopsy for the purpose of screening for this clinical trial (including able and willing to give valid written consent) to ability or to provide an available archival tumor sample taken less than 3 months prior to study enrollment if a fresh tumor biopsy is not feasible with an acceptable clinical risk; tumor lesions used for fresh biopsies should be the same lesions to be irradiated when possible and should not be the same lesions used as RECIST target lesions, unless there are no other lesions accessible * Microsatellite stable (MSS) tumor as documented by either: ** Immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing that does not suggest loss of MLH-1, MSH-2, PMS2 or MSH6 ** Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing that does not suggest microsatellite instability (MSI)
180.0
Must have a tumor lesion safely accessible for biopsy per the investigator�s discretion; while a soft tissue metastasis is preferred for a biopsy, a bone metastasis is allowed for biopsy as long as enough cores can be obtained; a biopsied lesion cannot be used for target lesion for response assessment
90.0
Must be agreeable to the mandatory research tumor biopsies (pre-treatment and on-treatment); tumor biopsies are mandatory at pre-treatment and at on-treatment; there is an optional biopsy at post-progression

Patient must have archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue specimen from the original diagnostic biopsy available for submission to Adaptive Biotechnologies for ClonoSEQ ID molecular marker identification of unique clonal immunoglobulin deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence* NOTE: Patients for whom the molecular marker is identified will have peripheral blood collected after completion of induction (patient�s disease status is PR or CR) and submitted to Adaptive Biotechnologies for minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment
689.0
Willingness to undergo a tumor biopsy
22.0
Willingness to provide mandatory tissue and blood samples for correlative studies
40.0
Patients must have a minimum of five, available unstained slides from the residual (post-neoadjuvant) invasive tumor in primary site or lymph node; (these will be submitted to determine PD-L1 expression) the tumor tissue must be adequate for PD-L1 testing, which typically requires a minimum of 100 cancer cells per slide* NOTE: Initial order for specimen kits should be placed at least two weeks prior to registering the first patient at each site
