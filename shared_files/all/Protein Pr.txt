STEP I: Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease as defined by having one or more of the following, obtained within 28 days prior to randomization:* >= 1 g/dL monoclonal protein (M-protein) on serum protein electrophoresis* >= 200 mg/24 hours (hrs) of monoclonal protein on a 24 hour urine protein electrophoresis* Involved free light chain >= 10 mg/dL or >= 100 mg/L AND abnormal serum immunoglobulin kappa to lambda free light chain ratio (< 0.26 or > 1.65)* Monoclonal bone marrow plasmacytosis >= 30% (evaluable disease)* Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP), and serum free light chain (FLC) assay are required to be performed within 28 days prior to randomization; a bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate is required within 28 days if bone marrow is being followed for response** NOTE: UPEP (on a 24-hour collection) is required, no substitute method is acceptable; urine must be followed monthly if the baseline urine M-spike is >= 200 mg/24 hr; please note that if both serum and urine M-components are present, both must be followed in order to evaluate response** NOTE: The serum free light chain test is required to be done if the patient does not have measurable disease in the serum or urine; measurable disease in the serum is defined as having a serum M-spike >= 1 g/dL; measurable disease in the urine is defined as having a urine M-spike >= 200 mg/24 hr

Patients must have measurable disease defined as any of the following:* Serum monoclonal protein >= 500 mg/dL by protein electrophoresis * > 200 mg of monoclonal protein in the urine on screening 24-hour electrophoresis * Serum immunoglobulin free light chain >= 100 mg/L AND abnormal serum immunoglobulin kappa to lambda free light chain ratio

Proteinuria of CTCAE grade 3 or higher (estimated by urine protein: creatinine ratio >= 3.5 on a random urine sample); patients who recently (i.e., at least 30 days prior to registration) discontinued an anti-angiogenic therapy which caused proteinuria (ie, grade 2 (> 2 to > 3 g of protein or 1-3.5 g/24 hours [h]) or grade 3 proteinuria (> 4 of protein or > 3.5 g/24 h) are not eligible for enrollment until proteinuria improves to < 2 g of protein per 24 h
