Patient with poorly controlled diabetes (defined as fasting glucose level > 200 mg/dL; optimally participants will have glucose < 150 mg/dL) despite attempts to improve glucose control by fasting duration and adjustment of medications

TREATMENT: Patients who have poorly controlled diabetes (defined as fasting blood glucose of > 160 mg/dL (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grade >= 2) and glycated hemoglobin (HgA1c) > 8% are ineligible to receive treatment with everolimus on study; patients with fasting blood glucose > 160 mg/dL may be eligible if the HgA1c < 8%, per PI discretion

It is recommended glucose be drawn fasting >= 8 hrs; glucose < 126 (diabetics 40ï¿½75 years of age are not eligible), within 30 days prior to enrollment* If glucose is >= 126 the glucose should be repeated fasting to determine eligibility
