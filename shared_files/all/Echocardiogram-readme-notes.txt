Ejection fraction is the most common surrogate for contractility, although it suffers from being load dependent. Ejection fraction (EF), is shown in the following equation:

EF=(End-diastolicvolume)-(End-systolicvolume)(End-diastolicvolume)
EF is normally 65% to 80% and does not change appreciably with age. Shortening fraction (SF) is the equivalent measure in the common setting when only the ventricular diameters are known.

SF=(End-diastolicdiameter)-(End-systolicdiameter)(End-diastolicdiameter)
The normal value for SF is >0.28, with a range of 0.28 to 0.44 (Gutgesell et al., 1977). The concept of SF was developed when the only echocardiographic modality available was M-mode, which utilizes an echo representation in only one dimension.
